Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
Ans: Function arguments are install in registers a0 ~ a7, 13 in main's call stored in a2.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
Ans: There's no any call to function f in the assembly code for main.

At what address is the function printf located?
Ans: 0x630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
Ans: 0x38

Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
Ans: HEll0 World

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? 
Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
Ans: 0x00646c72 change to 0x00726c64, 57616 don't need any change.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
Ans: In my computer it print 8234. It will print any value which store in the a2 register.
